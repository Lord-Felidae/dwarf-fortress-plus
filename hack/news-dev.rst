DFHack 0.47.05-r7
=================

New Plugins
-----------
- `autobutcher`: split off from `zone` into its own plugin. Note that to enable, the command has changed from ``autobutcher start`` to ``enable autobutcher``.
- `autonestbox`: split off from `zone` into its own plugin. Note that to enable, the command has changed from ``autonestbox start`` to ``enable autonestbox``.
- `overlay`: display a "DFHack" button in the lower left corner that you can click to start the new GUI command launcher. The `dwarfmonitor` weather display had to be moved to make room for the button. If you are seeing the weather indicator rendered over the overlay button, please remove the ``dfhack-config/dwarfmonitor.json`` file to fix the weather indicator display offset.

New Scripts
-----------
- `gui/kitchen-info`: adds more info to the Kitchen screen
- `gui/launcher`: in-game command launcher with autocomplete, history, and context-sensitive help
- `gui/workorder-details`: adjusts work orders' input item, material, traits
- `max-wave`: dynamically limit the next immigration wave, can be set to repeat
- `pop-control`: persistent per fortress population cap, `hermit`, and `max-wave` management
- `warn-stealers`: warn when creatures that may steal your food, drinks, or items become visible

New Internal Commands
---------------------
- `tags`: new built-in command to list the tool category tags and their definitions. tags associated with each tool are visible in the tool help and in the output of `ls`.

Fixes
-----
- `autochop`: designate largest trees for chopping first, instead of the smallest
- `devel/query`: fixed error when --tile is specified
- `dig-now`: Fix direction of smoothed walls when adjacent to a door or floodgate
- `dwarf-op`: fixed error when applying the Miner job to dwarves
- `emigration`: fix emigrant logic so unhappy dwarves leave as designed

- `gui/unit-info-viewer`: fix logic for displaying undead creature names
- `gui/workflow`: restore functionality to the add/remove/order hotkeys on the workflow status screen
- `quickfort`: `Dreamfort <quickfort-blueprint-guide>` blueprint set: declare the hospital zone before building the coffer; otherwise DF fails to stock the hospital with materials
- `view-item-info`: fixed a couple errors when viewing items without materials
- ``dfhack.buildings.findCivzonesAt``: no longer return duplicate civzones after loading a save with existing civzones
- ``dfhack.run_script``: ensure the arguments passed to scripts are always strings. This allows other scripts to call ``run_script`` with numeric args and it won't break parameter parsing.
- ``job.removeJob()``: ensure jobs are removed from the world list when they are canceled

Misc Improvements
-----------------
- History files: ``dfhack.history``, ``tiletypes.history``, ``lua.history``, and ``liquids.history`` have moved to the ``dfhack-config`` directory. If you'd like to keep the contents of your current history files, please move them to ``dfhack-config``.
- Init scripts: ``dfhack.init`` and other init scripts have moved to ``dfhack-config/init/``. If you have customized your ``dfhack.init`` file and want to keep your changes, please move the part that you have customized to the new location at ``dfhack-config/init/dfhack.init``. If you do not have changes that you want to keep, do not copy anything, and the new defaults will be used automatically.
- UX:
    - You can now move the cursor around in DFHack text fields in ``gui/`` scripts (e.g. `gui/blueprint`, `gui/quickfort`, or `gui/gm-editor`). You can move the cursor by clicking where you want it to go with the mouse or using the Left/Right arrow keys.  Ctrl+Left/Right will move one word at a time, and Alt+Left/Right will move to the beginning/end of the text.
    - You can now click on the hotkey hint text in many ``gui/`` script windows to activate the hotkey, like a button. Not all scripts have been updated to use the clickable widget yet, but you can try it in `gui/blueprint` or `gui/quickfort`.
    - Label widget scroll icons are replaced with scrollbars that represent the percentage of text on the screen and move with the position of the visible text, just like web browser scrollbars.
- `devel/query`:
    - inform the user when a query has been truncated due to ``--maxlength`` being hit.
    - increased default maxlength value from 257 to 2048

- `dwarf-op`: replaces [ a b c ] option lists with a,b,c option lists
- `gui/gm-unit`: don't clear the list filter when you adjust a skill value
- `gui/quickfort`:
    - better formatting for the generated manager orders report
    - you can now click on the map to move the blueprint anchor point to that tile instead of having to use the cursor movement keys
    - display an error message when the blueprints directory cannot be found
- `gui/workorder-details`: new keybinding on the workorder details screen: ``D``
- `keybinding`: support backquote (\`) as a hotkey (and assign the hotkey to the new `gui/launcher` interface)
- `ls`: can now filter tools by substring or tag. note that dev scripts are hidden by default. pass the ``--dev`` option to show them.
- `manipulator`:
    - add a library of useful default professions
    - move professions configuration from ``professions/`` to ``dfhack-config/professions/`` to keep it together with other dfhack configuration. If you have saved professions that you would like to keep, please manually move them to the new folder.
- `orders`: added useful library of manager orders. see them with ``orders list`` and import them with, for example, ``orders import library/basic``
- `prioritize`: new ``defaults`` keyword to prioritize the list of jobs that the community agrees should generally be prioritized. Run ``prioritize -a defaults`` to try it out in your fort!
- `prospect`: add new ``--show`` option to give the player control over which report sections are shown. e.g. ``prospect all --show ores`` will just show information on ores.
- `quickfort`:
    - `Dreamfort <quickfort-blueprint-guide>` blueprint set improvements: set traffic designations to encourage dwarves to eat cooked food instead of raw ingredients
    - library blueprints are now included by default in ``quickfort list`` output. Use the new ``--useronly`` (or just ``-u``) option to filter out library bluerpints.
    - better error message when the blueprints directory cannot be found
- `seedwatch`: ``seedwatch all`` now adds all plants with seeds to the watchlist, not just the "basic" crops.
- ``materials.ItemTraitsDialog``: added a default ``on_select``-handler which toggles the traits.

- `devel/export-dt-ini`: fixed incorrect vtable address on Windows
- `quickfort`:
    - allow machines (e.g. screw pumps) to be built on ramps just like DF allows
    - fix error message when the requested label is not found in the blueprint file

- `dorf_tables`: integrated `devel/query` to show the table definitions when requested with ``-list``
- `geld`: fixed ``-help`` option
- `gui/gm-editor`: made search case-insensitive
- `orders`:
    - support importing and exporting reaction-specific item conditions, like "lye-containing" for soap production orders
    - new ``sort`` command. sorts orders according to their repeat frequency. this prevents daily orders from blocking other orders for simlar items from ever getting completed.
- `quickfort`:
    - Dreamfort blueprint set improvements: extensive revision based on playtesting and feedback. includes updated ``onMapLoad_dreamfort.init`` settings file, enhanced automation orders, and premade profession definitions.  see full changelog at https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/pull/1921 and https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/pull/1925

DFHack 0.47.05-r2
=================

New Scripts
-----------
- `clear-webs`: removes all webs on the map and/or frees any webbed creatures
- `devel/block-borders`: overlay that displays map block borders
- `devel/luacov`: generate code test coverage reports for script development. Define the ``DFHACK_ENABLE_LUACOV=1`` environment variable to start gathering coverage metrics.

- `gui/blueprint`: interactive frontend for the `blueprint` plugin (with mouse support!)
- `gui/mass-remove`: mass removal/suspension tool for buildings and constructions
- `reveal-hidden-sites`: exposes all undiscovered sites
- `set-timeskip-duration`: changes the duration of the "Updating World" process preceding the start of a new game, enabling you to jump in earlier or later than usual

Fixes
-----
- Fixed an issue preventing some external scripts from creating zones and other abstract buildings (see note about room definitions under "Internals")
- Fixed an issue where scrollable text in Lua-based screens could prevent other widgets from scrolling
- `bodyswap`:
    - stopped prior party members from tagging along after bodyswapping and reloading the map
    - made companions of bodyswapping targets get added to the adventurer party - they can now be viewed using the in-game party system
- `buildingplan`:
    - fixed an issue where planned constructions designated with DF's sizing keys (``umkh``) would sometimes be larger than requested
    - fixed an issue preventing other plugins like `automaterial` from planning constructions if the "enable all" buildingplan setting was turned on
    - made navigation keys work properly in the materials selection screen when alternate keybindings are used
- `color-schemes`: fixed an error in the ``register`` subcommand when the DF path contains certain punctuation characters
- `command-prompt`: fixed issues where overlays created by running certain commands (e.g. `gui/liquids`, `gui/teleport`) would not update the parent screen correctly
- `dwarfvet`: fixed a crash that could occur with hospitals overlapping with other buildings in certain ways
- `embark-assistant`: fixed faulty early exit in first search attempt when searching for waterfalls
- `gui/advfort`: fixed an issue where starting a workshop job while not standing at the center of the workshop required advancing time manually
- `gui/unit-info-viewer`: fixed size description displaying unrelated values instead of size
- `orders`: fixed crash when importing orders with malformed IDs
- `quickfort`:
    - comments in blueprint cells no longer prevent the rest of the row from being read. A cell with a single '#' marker in it, though, will still stop the parser from reading further in the row.
    - fixed an off-by-one line number accounting in blueprints with implicit ``#dig`` modelines
    - changed to properly detect and report an error on sub-alias params with no values instead of just failing to apply the alias later (if you really want an empty value, use ``{Empty}`` instead)
    - improved handling of non-rectangular and non-solid extent-based structures (like fancy-shaped stockpiles and farm plots)
    - fixed conversion of numbers to DF keycodes in ``#query`` blueprints
    - fixed various errors with cropping across the map edge
    - properly reset config to default values in ``quickfort reset`` even if if the ``dfhack-config/quickfort/quickfort.txt`` config file doesn't mention all config vars. Also now works even if the config file doesn't exist.
- `stonesense`: fixed a crash that could occur when ctrl+scrolling or closing the Stonesense window
- ``quickfortress.csv`` blueprint: fixed refuse stockpile config and prevented stockpiles from covering stairways

Misc Improvements
-----------------
- Added adjectives to item selection dialogs, used in tools like `gui/create-item` - this makes it possible to differentiate between different types of high/low boots, shields, etc. (some of which are procedurally generated)
- `blueprint`:
    - made ``depth`` and ``name`` parameters optional. ``depth`` now defaults to ``1`` (current level only) and ``name`` defaults to "blueprint"
    - ``depth`` can now be negative, which will result in the blueprints being written from the highest z-level to the lowest. Before, blueprints were always written from the lowest z-level to the highest.
    - added the ``--cursor`` option to set the starting coordinate for the generated blueprints. A game cursor is no longer necessary if this option is used.
- `devel/annc-monitor`: added ``report enable|disable`` subcommand to filter combat reports
- `embark-assistant`: slightly improved performance of surveying and improved code a little
- `gui/advfort`: added workshop name to workshop UI
- `quickfort`:
    - the Dreamfort blueprint set can now be comfortably built in a 1x1 embark
    - added the ``--cursor`` option for running a blueprint at specific coordinates instead of starting at the game cursor position
    - added more helpful error messages for invalid modeline markers
    - added support for extra space characters in blueprints
    - added a warning when an invalid alias is encountered instead of silently ignoring it
    - made more quiet when the ``--quiet`` parameter is specified
- `setfps`: improved error handling
- `stonesense`: sped up startup time
- `tweak` hide-priority: changed so that priorities stay hidden (or visible) when exiting and re-entering the designations menu
- `unretire-anyone`: the historical figure selection list now includes the ``SYN_NAME`` (necromancer, vampire, etc) of figures where applicable

API
---
- Added ``dfhack.maps.getPlantAtTile(x, y, z)`` and ``dfhack.maps.getPlantAtTile(pos)``, and updated ``dfhack.gui.getSelectedPlant()`` to use it
- Added ``dfhack.units.teleport(unit, pos)``

Internals
---------
- Room definitions and extents are now created for abstract buildings so callers don't have to initialize the room structure themselves
- The DFHack test harness is now much easier to use for iterative development.  Configuration can now be specified on the commandline, there are more test filter options, and the test harness can now easily rerun tests that have been run before.
- The ``test/main`` command to invoke the test harness has been renamed to just ``test``
- Unit tests can now use ``delay_until(predicate_fn, timeout_frames)`` to delay until a condition is met
- Unit tests must now match any output expected to be printed via ``dfhack.printerr()``
- Unit tests now support fortress mode (allowing tests that require a fortress map to be loaded) - note that these tests are skipped by continuous integration for now, pending a suitable test fortress

Lua
---
- new library: ``argparse`` is a collection of commandline argument processing functions
- new string utility functions:
    - ``string:wrap(width)`` wraps a string at space-separated word boundaries
    - ``string:trim()`` removes whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string
    - ``string:split(delimiter, plain)`` splits a string with the given delimiter and returns a table of substrings. if ``plain`` is specified and set to ``true``, ``delimiter`` is interpreted as a literal string instead of as a pattern (the default)
- new utility function: ``utils.normalizePath()``: normalizes directory slashes across platoforms to ``/`` and coaleses adjacent directory separators
- `reveal`: now exposes ``unhideFlood(pos)`` functionality to Lua
- `xlsxreader`: added Lua class wrappers for the xlsxreader plugin API
- ``argparse.processArgsGetopt()`` (previously ``utils.processArgsGetopt()``):
    - now returns negative numbers (e.g. ``-10``) in the list of positional parameters instead of treating it as an option string equivalent to ``-1 -0``
    - now properly handles ``--`` like GNU ``getopt`` as a marker to treat all further parameters as non-options
    - now detects when required arguments to long-form options are missing
- ``gui.dwarfmode``: new function: ``enterSidebarMode(sidebar_mode, max_esc)`` which uses keypresses to get into the specified sidebar mode from whatever the current screen is
- ``gui.Painter``: fixed error when calling ``viewport()`` method

Structures
----------
- Identified remaining rhythm beat enum values
- ``ui_advmode.interactions``: identified some fields related to party members
- ``ui_advmode_menu``: identified several enum items
- ``ui_advmode``:
    - identified several fields
    - renamed ``wait`` to ``rest_mode`` and changed to an enum with correct values
- ``viewscreen_legendsst.cur_page``: added missing ``Books`` enum item, which fixes some other values

Documentation
-------------
- Added more client library implementations to the `remote interface docs <remote-client-libs>`


DFHack 0.47.05-r1
=================

Fixes
-----
- `confirm`: stopped exposing alternate names when convicting units
- `prospector`: improved pre embark rough estimates, particularly for small clusters

Misc Improvements
-----------------
- `autohauler`: allowed the ``Alchemist`` labor to be enabled in `manipulator` and other labor screens so it can be used for its intended purpose of flagging that no hauling labors should be assigned to a dwarf. Before, the only way to set the flag was to use an external program like Dwarf Therapist.
- `embark-assistant`: slightly improved performance of surveying
- `gui/no-dfhack-init`: clarified how to dismiss dialog that displays when no ``dfhack.init`` file is found
- `quickfort`:
    - Dreamfort blueprint set improvements: `significant <http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=176889.msg8239017#msg8239017>`_ refinements across the entire blueprint set. Dreamfort is now much faster, much more efficient, and much easier to use. The `checklist <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PVZ2h3Mm3x_G1OXQvwKd7oIR2lK4A1Ahf6Om1kFigw/edit#gid=1459509569>`__ now includes a mini-walkthrough for quick reference. The spreadsheet now also includes `embark profile suggestions <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PVZ2h3Mm3x_G1OXQvwKd7oIR2lK4A1Ahf6Om1kFigw/edit#gid=149144025>`__
    - added aliases for configuring masterwork and artifact core quality for all stockpile categories that have them; made it possible to take from multiple stockpiles in the ``quantumstop`` alias
    - an active cursor is no longer required for running #notes blueprints (like the dreamfort walkthrough)
    - you can now be in any mode with an active cursor when running ``#query`` blueprints (before you could only be in a few "approved" modes, like look, query, or place)
    - refined ``#query`` blueprint sanity checks: cursor should still be on target tile at end of configuration, and it's ok for the screen ID to change if you are destroying (or canceling destruction of) a building
    - now reports how many work orders were added when generating manager orders from blueprints in the gui dialog
    - added ``--dry-run`` option to process blueprints but not change any game state
    - you can now specify the number of desired barrels, bins, and wheelbarrows for individual stockpiles when placing them
    - ``quickfort orders`` on a ``#place`` blueprint will now enqueue manager orders for barrels, bins, or wheelbarrows that are explicitly set in the blueprint.
    - you can now add alias definitions directly to your blueprint files instead of having to put them in a separate aliases.txt file. makes sharing blueprints with custom alias definitions much easier.

Structures
----------
- Identified scattered enum values (some rhythm beats, a couple of corruption unit thoughts, and a few language name categories)
- ``viewscreen_loadgamest``: renamed ``cur_step`` enumeration to match style of ``viewscreen_adopt_regionst`` and ``viewscreen_savegamest``
- ``viewscreen_savegamest``: identified ``cur_step`` enumeration

Documentation
-------------
- `digfort`: added deprecation warnings - digfort has been replaced by `quickfort`
- `fortplan`: added deprecation warnings - fortplan has been replaced by `quickfort`

- `buildingplan`:
    - added ability to set global settings from the console, e.g.  ``buildingplan set boulders false``
    - added "enable all" option for buildingplan (so you don't have to enable all building types individually). This setting is not persisted (just like quickfort_mode is not persisted), but it can be set from onMapLoad.init
    - modified ``Planning Mode`` status in the UI to show whether the plugin is in quickfort mode, "enable all" mode, or whether just the building type is enabled.
- `quickfort`:
    - Dreamfort blueprint set improvements: added a streamlined checklist for all required dreamfort commands and gave names to stockpiles, levers, bridges, and zones
    - added aliases for bronze weapons and armor
    - added alias for tradeable crafts
    - new blueprint mode: ``#ignore``, useful for scratch space or personal notes
    - implement ``{Empty}`` keycode for use in quickfort aliases; useful for defining blank-by-default alias values
    - more flexible commandline parsing allowing for more natural parameter ordering (e.g. where you used to have to write ``quickfort list dreamfort -l`` you can now write ``quickfort list -l dreamfort``)
    - print out blueprint names that a ``#meta`` blueprint is applying so it's easier to understand what meta blueprints are doing
    - whitespace is now allowed between a marker name and the opening parenthesis in blueprint modelines. for example, ``#dig start (5; 5)`` is now valid (you used to be required to write ``#dig start(5; 5)``)

Lua
---
- ``dfhack.run_command()``: changed to interface directly with the console when possible, which allows interactive commands and commands that detect the console encoding to work properly
- ``processArgsGetopt()`` added to utils.lua, providing a callback interface for parameter parsing and getopt-like flexibility for parameter ordering and combination (see docs in ``library/lua/utils.lua`` and ``library/lua/3rdparty/alt_getopt.lua`` for details).

Structures
----------
- ``job``: identified ``order_id`` field

    - fixed valid placement detection for floor hatches, floor grates, and floor bars (they were erroneously being rejected from open spaces and staircase tops)
    - fixed query blueprint statistics being added to the wrong metric when both a query and a zone blueprint are run by the same meta blueprint
    - added missing blueprint labels in gui dialog list
    - fixed occupancy settings for extent-based structures so that stockpiles can be placed within other stockpiles (e.g. in a checkerboard or bullseye pattern)

Lua
---
- Exposed ``get_vector()`` (from C++) for all types that support ``find()``, e.g. ``df.unit.get_vector() == df.global.world.units.all``

Structures
----------
- Added ``buildings_other_id.DISPLAY_CASE``
- Fixed ``unit`` alignment
- Fixed ``viewscreen_titlest.start_savegames`` alignment
- Identified ``historical_entity.unknown1b.deities`` (deity IDs)
